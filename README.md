# boston-housing-ML
A machine learning project for my training journey on the data-scientist career path.  

## Introduction

## About the dataset
The project relies on the [boston housing dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html), originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. *'Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air'*, J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.

## Data-cleaning

## Exploratory data analysis

## Predictons model

## Going further *(draf)*

 - compare the dataset with more a more recent one and evaluate the differences
 - from there, take in consideration the differences between mindset (ex: proportion of blacks by town)

## How to run
